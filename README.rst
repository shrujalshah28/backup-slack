**Notice:** I'm not currently using or maintaining this code.

It worked when I last tried it in mid-2017, but there may be bugs or Slack API changes that cause issues.
I don't have the time or energy to work on this right now â€“ feel free to use the code, but any fixes will have to go in a fork.

slack_history
=============

This is a tool for backing up your message history from Slack.

It uses the Slack API to download the history of your public/private
channels and direct message threads, and save them as a JSON file.
(The `data exports <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248>`_
provided by Slack only include messages sent in public channels.)
If you're using one of the paid tiers, this retrieves your complete
history.  For the free tiers, only the last 10,000 messages are accessible
through the Slack API.

*This tool is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Slack Technologies, Inc.*

Installation
------------

To install this script, use pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -e git+git://github.com/shrujalshah28/backup-slack.git#egg=backup_slack

or `pipsi <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pipsi install -e git+git://github.com/shrujalshah28/backup-slack.git#egg=backup_slack

You can use Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+.

Usage
-----

You run the tool on the command-line, passing a `Slack API token
<https://api.slack.com/web>`_ for authentication:

.. code-block:: console

   $ backup_slack --token='abcdef'

This saves a series of JSON files to the current directory.  To see other
options, run with the ``--help`` flag: 

.. code-block:: console

   $ backup_slack --help
